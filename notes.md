# Machine Learning Overview

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data, rather than being explicitly programmed for every specific rule.

In tradditional programming, you have to write specific instructions.

In Machine Learning, you feed the system examples (data) and it figures out the rules itself. For example, instead of writing rules to define what a "spam email" looks llike, you feed an ML algorithm thousands of emails labeled "spam" or "not spam", and it learns to identify the patterns (like speficic words, sender reputation, etc) on its own.

Key concepts include:

* Supervised Learning: Training a model on labeled data (e.g., teaching a computer to recognize cats by showing it pictures labeled "cat).

* Unsupervised Learning: Finding hiddle patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., grouping customers by purchasing behavior without knowing the groups beforehand).

* Neural Networks: Algorithms inspired by the human brian structure, often used in "Deep Learning" for complex tasks like images and speech recognition.
